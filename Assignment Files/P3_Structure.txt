Project 3 Data Structure


As stated in the requirements, this database should be able to display and allow the users to actively modify the information of tenants and apartment units in one place.


Because tenants and apartment units are objects that will introduce lots of multiple fields of values, I think applying a hash structure in this Redis database would be the most appropriate. With the hash structure, I would be able to use functions such as HSET and HGETALL to quickly process the data in the way I like with the least hassle.
